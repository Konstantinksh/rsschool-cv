#### Briefly about me ####
I am 27 years old. I currently work as a designer of heating ventilation and air conditioning. I daily use Autodesk Autocad and Revit in my work. These products allow to use some plugins and scripts to improve quality and speed of designing. In process of developing scripts and plugins i understood that developing software and apps is interesting for me. Maybe even more than my first specialization.  
For ten i was living in Minsk and was a member of Minsk HackerSpace. Almost all of the members of this organization are IT specialists. This community and their example show me that developing opens unbordered opportunity to creation and can make my life interesting.
